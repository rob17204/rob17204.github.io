                <p>Middle School Band is the first level of ensemble to participate in District Festival here at Forest Area.  Students will learn advanced musical concepts and apply them in a performance setting.  We use the <em>Scott Rush book Habits of a Successful Middle School Musician</em> for fundamental work and warmups.  Middle School band students can participate in the marching band in the fall and 8th graders will perform with the marching band in the spring at Trout Festival and 4th of July parades. Students have the option to participate in District Solo and Ensemble Festival in the spring.</p>
